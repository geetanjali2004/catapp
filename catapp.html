                <ul><i><b>THINGS THAT CAT LOVES</i></b></ul>
                <li><b>Cats love grooming themselves and being groomed.</b></li>
                <dd>Would it surprise you to learn that cats spend anywhere from two to six hours a day cleaning and conditioning their coat and claws? That’s right. Whether they’re grooming themselves, another cat or even their human, cats love to be as clean as possible. Their sandpaper-like tongues help remove dirt while dispersing skin oils throughout their coats.</dd>
                <li><b>Cats love high places for watching and hiding</b></li>
                <dd>Jumping and climbing to high places continues to be a normal behavior for our domesticated cats. Like their ancestors, your feline friends seek out high places to survey their home territory and to escape from another pet in the home, a young child or something that scares them. You can satisfy your cat’s love of high places by providing “approved” places for climbing, jumping, escaping, resting and surveying the environment. Indoor cat “tree” furniture with a variety of surfaces and comfortable platforms is an excellent alternative to your kitchen counters, bookshelves or fireplace mantels.</dd>
                <li><b>Cats love sleeping and napping.</b></li>
                <dd>It’s no secret that cats sleep a lot. In fact, the average cat sleeps for 15 to 16 hours per day, on average. Kittens and geriatric kitties may nap as much as 20 hours daily. That’s more time than your cat spends doing anything else, including eating. If you’re concerned that your cat may be sleeping too much or too little, talk to your veterinarian about what’s normal for your kitty’s breed, age, size and activity level.</dd>
                <li><b>Cats love a stimulating environment.</b></li>
                <dd>Cats are naturally curious and need some type of challenge or entertainment every day. While living indoors keeps cats safe from predators, cars and other dangers, it can also be boring for your kitties. Like us and dogs, cats need to expend energy and use their minds to be healthy and happy. Cats need a variety of toys, including those they can play with on their own (for while you’re at work) and those that you can use to play with them. And a window perch is a great place for your kitty to nap or watch birds and squirrels.</dd>

                <ul> <b><i> THINGS THAT CAT HATES</i></b></ul>
                <li> <b> Competition </b></li>
                <dd>Cats are competitive by nature. <br> Your cat is likely to not be very impressed if another feline shows up on the scene and this can sometimes result in aggressive behaviour. </dd>
                <li><b> Strangers</b></li>
                <dd>Cats are wary of strangers. If someone they don’t know suddenly walks into your house (which to your cat, is actually their house), they might feel frightened and confused. <br>
                     Make sure your guest is aware of your fur baby’s feelings and try to stop them from petting your cat. <br>
                     Keeping a distance will help your cat suss out the situation and allow them to make the first move if they’re feeling friendly.</dd>
                <li><b>Being cradled like a baby</b></li>
                <dd>We know that your kitty is your baby but they really don’t like being cradled. <br> Some cat owners hold their cats like they would their newborns and this can be quite stressful for them as it puts your cat in a position where they can’t get away. <br>
                     Always let your cat come to you for cuddles and make sure they have the option to leave if they want to.</dd>
                <li><b>Too much attention</b></li>
                <dd>
                    If you’re a cat mum or dad then you’ll know that cats are independent creatures. They can’t stand over-aggressive petting and many of them just like doing their own thing. <br>
                     Respect your cat’s boundaries and don’t try to force them to spend time with you if they don’t want to- they will let you know when they need love and affection!
